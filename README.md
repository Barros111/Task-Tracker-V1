📝 Task Tracker V1

Author: Guilherme Barros
Project: My first ever Python project! 🎉

🚀 Description

Task Tracker V1 is a simple command-line Python application to manage your tasks.
It allows you to:

✅ Create new tasks

📋 List all tasks

🔄 Update task status (todo, in-progress, done)

❌ Delete tasks

Each task is saved as a JSON file, so your tasks persist between sessions.

🛠 Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Clone this repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>


Navigate to the project folder and run:

python src/main.py

💡 Usage

Run the program.

Follow the menu to create, update, list, or delete tasks.

Your tasks are stored in the Tasks/ folder as JSON files.

📌 Notes

This is my first ever Python project, so it’s simple but functional.

The code can be expanded and improved with more features in the future, like sorting tasks or filtering by status.
